By selecting technical parameters such as operating range and seat capacity, it's possible to analyze inter-European and Italian domestic routes that could be operated with such aircraft. The dashboard offers several KPIs regarding the overall number of affected flights, fuel savings, emission reduction and the effect on operating costs, accompanied by the display of potentially replaceable routes.",

Three scenarios are displayed, each based on a type of aircraft currently being developed: Scenario 1 – Heart Aerospace ES-19; Scenario 2 – Elysian E9X; Scenario 3 – Wright Project.",
    "biometric": "This section of the dashboard allows to estimate the potential use of facial recognition technology in airport processes. Starting from several parameters from the traditional process, such as airfare, wait times at security checks and at the gate, the modality of acquisition of biometric data (at home or at the airport) and the processing time with facial recognition, the chart displays the adoption rate for the service as a function of the biometrical airport process relative to the baseline (Δ%). The results are divided by business passengers, leisure passengers and the overall population.",
